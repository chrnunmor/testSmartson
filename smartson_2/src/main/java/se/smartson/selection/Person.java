/**
 * The @Entity tells Objectify about our entity.  We also register it in OfyHelper.java -- very
 * important. Our primary key @Id is set automatically by the Google Datastore for us.
 *
 * We add a @Parent to tell the object about its ancestor. We are doing this to support many
 * guestbooks.  Objectify, unlike the AppEngine library requires that you specify the fields you
 * want to index using @Index.  This is often a huge win in performance -- though if you don't Index
 * your data from the start, you'll have to go back and index it later.
 *
 * NOTE - all the properties are PUBLIC to keep this simple; otherwise,
 * Jackson wants us to write a BeanSerializer for cloud endpoints.
